## Project Description

- We have implemented a RISC-V single cycle processor.
- We have used many object oriented programming concepts and implemented a processor with alu , control unit and memory mocking the working of of a processor in exact same way which makes our code much more readable and intuitive. All of this combined with a gui.

- First we created a window gui with help of tkinter and linked the button commands to that of the processor.
- FETCH, we have a method of processor object fetch, it fetches the instruction from the data.mc file
- DECODE, a object of Instruction is created and we get access to all attributes of Instructions.
- EXECUTE,
ALU does its calculation and is used to determine the value of muxselect of the mux deciding PC, and the data is made available to memory.

- Memory Access,
Memory is written or accessed according to the type of instruction.

- Write Back, in the write back stage we are writing the value in destination register.
